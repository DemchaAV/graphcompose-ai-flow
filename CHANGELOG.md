# Changelog

All notable changes to **GraphCompose AI Template Flow** are recorded here.
The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and stays in
`0.x` while the workflow stabilizes — skills are still `needs-validation`, and
the full visual-baseline pass is the gate to `1.0.0`.

## Unreleased

### Live preview
- **`live/` mirror.** Every render now also writes a single stable copy of the
  latest output to `live/current.pdf` (plus `current-debug.pdf`, `current.png`,
  `current.txt`) at the repo root, regardless of which project/revision produced
  it. Open `live/current.pdf` once in SumatraPDF (auto-reloads on change, no
  file lock) and watch every render refresh in place — no digging for the latest
  revision folder. Override the location with `GRAPHCOMPOSE_LIVE_DIR`; disable
  with `RENDER_NO_LIVE=1`. The folder is gitignored.
- **`scripts/preview-live.mjs`** (`npm run preview` / `npm run preview:debug`)
  opens the live file in SumatraPDF with `-reuse-instance`, resolving it via
  `SUMATRAPDF_PATH`, `PATH`, or the standard install locations, and falling back
  to the OS default viewer.

### Developer workflow
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents the branch-per-change + release-from-`main`
  workflow that keeps `main` always renderable; `AGENTS.md` carries the
  agent-facing summary ("Working on the flow itself").

## v0.1.0 — 2026-06-03

First tagged release. The kit already turned visual references into
maintainable GraphCompose Java templates; this release makes it easy to pick
up — one-command setup, a dev container, a seedable example, and agent
rule-packs — and refreshes the docs and dependencies.

### Onboarding & tooling
- **One-command setup.** `npm run setup` (or `./setup.ps1` / `./setup.sh`)
  checks the toolchain (Node 20+, npm, Java 21+, Maven), installs and builds
  the local Node tools, and packages the Java preview renderer.
  `npm run setup:check` verifies the toolchain only.
- **Seedable example.** `graphcompose-flow init <name> --template invoice`
  scaffolds a ready-to-render project under `examples/<name>/` (reference,
  render-runner, a DRAFT `revision-001`, and a `render` block); render it
  immediately with `node scripts/render.mjs <name> revision-001`.
- **Dev container.** `.devcontainer/` provisions Java 21 (Temurin) + Maven,
  Node 20, and ImageMagick for GitHub Codespaces / VS Code; `postCreate` runs
  `npm run setup`. Validated with a real container build.
- **Agent rule-packs.** Thin pointers to `AGENTS.md` for Claude Code
  (`CLAUDE.md`), Cursor (`.cursor/rules/`), Windsurf (`.windsurf/rules/`), and
  GitHub Copilot (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`).
- **Pipeline helper.** `scripts/run-pipeline.mjs` prints the ordered agent
  chain for a revision's scope and runs the mechanical render with `--render`.

### Documentation
- README embeds a clickable YouTube walkthrough (plays from GitHub) instead of
  an inline `.mp4`.
- `docs/quickstart.md` leads with the setup script + a Codespaces note; manual
  steps moved into a `<details>` block.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` current-state refreshed: the preview renderer executes
  templates and writes `output.pdf` / `output.png`, and GraphCompose 1.6.7 is
  resolved via Maven Central.

### Dependencies & hygiene
- `vitest` bumped `1.6 → 4.1.8` in `revision-manager` and `visual-diff`,
  clearing all `npm audit` advisories (incl. one critical); tests stay green
  (31 + 39).
- Root-level junk cleanup; `.gitignore` guards for shell-accident filenames and
  the dev-container lockfile; the tooling install path is build-only.

### Skills
- `backgrounds-and-panels` expanded with the real page/section background API
  (`DocumentSession.pageBackground` / `pageBackgrounds`, `section.fillColor`)
  and a "Container fill vs page background" distinction.

### Versioning
- The on-disk artifact contract is now stamped: `template-project.json` and
  `revision.json` carry `schemaVersion: 1` on every write (older files without
  the field are treated as v1, so existing examples stay valid). The CLI tools
  stay repo-internal and versioned lock-step with the repo — not published to
  npm yet.

### Deferred (intentionally not in this release)
- `init --template cv` — a data-driven, multi-page CV seed; the invoice
  template ships now and cv follows in a later release.
- Publishing the CLI tools to npm — they stay repo-internal until there is a
  reason to publish.

### Compatibility matrix
| Component | Version |
|---|---|
| `graphcompose-ai-flow` (repo) | v0.1.0 |
| skill pack (`skillsVersion`) | 0.2.0 (`needs-validation`) |
| tools (revision-manager / visual-diff / asset-resolver / skill-validation-cache) | 0.1.0 (lock-step) |
| artifact contract | v1 — `schemaVersion: 1` stamped on new writes (absent = v1) |
| GraphCompose | supports 1.6.x, verified against 1.6.7 (Maven Central) |
| Toolchain | Java 21, Node 20, Maven |
