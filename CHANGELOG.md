# Changelog

All notable changes to **GraphCompose AI Template Flow** are recorded here.
The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and stays in
`0.x` while the workflow stabilizes — skills are still `needs-validation`, and
the full visual-baseline pass is the gate to `1.0.0`.

## Unreleased

### v0.5.0-beta.3

- **`init --template` works outside a checkout.** It looked for the seed
  by walking up from `process.cwd()` for the repository, so an installed
  user got "must run inside the graphcompose-ai-flow repository" and
  could not use it at all. The seed ships with the harness, so it is now
  found from the module's own location — true in a checkout, in
  `~/.codex/graphcompose-flow/<version>/` and in the plugin cache alike.
- **The seeded project lands where the caller stands**, exactly like the
  empty scaffold, instead of being forced to `<install>/examples/<name>`.
  That rule came from `runRender` resolving projects as
  `examples/<projectId>`; it takes an explicit `projectDir` now, and
  honouring the old rule would have written a user's project into the
  harness install. `cd examples && init --template` in a checkout is
  unaffected.
- **Seeds are pinned to a GraphCompose line and cross-line seeding is
  refused.** A seed is real Java against one API: the 1.7 invoice does
  not compile against 2.x — the whole
  `com.demcha.compose.document.templates.*` tree moved — so seeding it
  into a 2.2 project produced something that could not build. The error
  names both lines and points at the empty scaffold. Within a line the
  caller's patch version wins, and the seeded runner's
  `<graphcompose.version>` is repointed at it; nothing overrides that
  property at render time, so an unrewritten runner silently built
  against the seed's version.
- **`scripts/init-workspace.mjs --template <name>`** threads the flag
  through, so workspace, project and seed are one command.

  **Known gap:** the only seed is `invoice` on the 1.7 line, so
  `--template` is unavailable on 1.9 and 2.2 by design rather than by
  accident. Closing it needs an invoice example ported to the current
  line, which is example work, not a fix to this command.

### v0.5.0-beta.2

- **`scripts/init-workspace.mjs`** — see the entry under Public API
  below. The version is bumped rather than folded into `beta.1` because
  `claude plugin update` compares version strings, not commits: a fix
  shipped under an unchanged version never reaches an installed user,
  and the CLI reports them "already at the latest version".

### v0.5.0-beta.1 — the harness migration

The project stops being a workflow kit that a coding agent has to
interpret and becomes an installable harness for Claude Code and Codex.
The host supplies the model, the reasoning and the shell; this project
supplies workflow, GraphCompose knowledge and gates; anything a script
can decide is decided by a script.

#### Public API

- **Four workflow skills** replace the eleven-prompt chain —
  `skills/workflows/{create,revise,review,approve}-template/SKILL.md`,
  one per user gesture, over four shared references (workspace, scope
  routing, iteration loop, authoring rules). `prompts/` and the
  `docs/agents.md` that described it have been removed; the stages are
  now named by what they do in `config/pipeline.json`.
- **`config/pipeline.json`** is the single source of scope → stages, the
  gate each scope ends on, the loop bounds and the failure categories.
  `scripts/run-pipeline.mjs` holds no chain of its own; the orchestrator
  prompt and the revision schema point at the config instead of
  restating it.
- **Workspace decoupling.** Work lives in the user's Java project under
  `graphcompose-flow/`, resolved by `--root`, `GRAPHCOMPOSE_FLOW_ROOT`,
  discovery from the cwd, or this repository's own `examples/` in
  development. `scripts/lib/workspace.mjs` is the only resolver.
- **`scripts/init-workspace.mjs`** creates that workspace, and is the
  first command to run in a project that has none. It resolves the
  GraphCompose pin, seeds the manifest with it, and with `--project <id>`
  creates the project inside `projects/`. Idempotent; exit 0 created or
  present, 2 usage error, 3 project exists.

  This closes a hole rather than adding a convenience. `initWorkspace()`
  existed but no CLI called it — the workflow reference told the agent to
  import the module inline — so the step deciding *where every later
  command writes* had no deterministic backstop, and skipping it failed
  silently: with no manifest, resolution falls through to install mode,
  whose projects directory is the harness's own `examples/`. A user
  following the documented flow would have had their work written into
  the installed runtime, with every command agreeing it belonged there.
- **`graphcompose-flow init` accepts `--target-version` / `--skill-pack`.**
  Both were reachable from `runInit` but not from the CLI, so every
  project it created claimed GraphCompose 1.9.0 whatever the project
  actually pinned, and the mismatch first surfaced as a compile error
  against the wrong allow-list.
- **`scripts/resolve-version.mjs`** reads the GraphCompose pin from the
  user's `pom.xml` / `build.gradle(.kts)` and maps it to a skill pack.
  Exit 0 supported, 3 unsupported, 4 not a GraphCompose project. An
  unsupported line is a stop, never a fallback to the nearest pack.
- **`scripts/iterate-status.mjs`** enforces the loop bounds that were
  previously only declared: exit 0 ready for approval, 2 revise, 3
  blocked, counting iterations, consecutive build failures and repeats of
  the same mismatch id.
- **GraphCompose 2.2 skill pack** (`skills/versions/graphcompose-2.2/`),
  generated from the `v2.2.0` tag — 268 types, 1886 methods, 317
  constants — and now the manifest default. 1.9 joins 1.6 and 1.7 as a
  frozen snapshot. Each pack gains a `00-loading-map.md` so a task opens
  four to six files instead of seventeen.
- **Packaging.** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `marketplace.json` and
  four slash commands for Claude Code; `adapters/codex/install.mjs` for
  Codex, installing stubs that point at the canonical skills rather than
  copying them.
- **`npm run verify`** runs every gate locally, fail-fast, with `--quick`
  for the steps that need no Java or network.
- `graphcompose-flow fail` takes `--category`, `--stage` and `--message`.

#### Fixed

- `graphcompose-flow fail` wrote `status: FAILED` with no `failure`
  record, which its own schema requires. Reproduced and confirmed with
  ajv; it now always writes one, using `stage: "unspecified"` rather
  than inventing a plausible stage.
- `graphcompose-flow` and `visual-diff` died with a raw
  `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` on a fresh clone, because `dist/` is not
  committed. They now exit 69 naming `npm run setup`.
- `tools/api-surface/api-index.py` silently wrote an **empty** allow-list
  when it parsed nothing, and only understood the 1.x source layout. It
  now refuses to write an empty index, scans the 2.x reactor modules
  (`core/`, `templates/`), and emits the frontmatter the repository
  contract requires.
- Two documented commands used a bash line continuation, which PowerShell
  reads as a literal.

#### Documentation

- `docs/architecture.md` — the layer split, the loop, the contracts, the
  workspace model, and what is deliberately excluded (no LLM API, no MCP,
  no standalone runtime).
- `docs/plugin-installation.md`, `adapters/codex/README.md`,
  `docs/demo.md` (real captured output), and a README that leads with
  installation rather than concept.
- `AGENTS.md` cut from 346 lines to a dispatcher: which skill owns the
  task, seven invariants, the commands, where each contract is declared.

#### Tests

- 78 root contract tests on the built-in `node:test` runner (no new
  dependency), plus 7 ajv schema tests, wired into CI as
  `harness-contracts` — the root suite had not been running in CI at all.
- Four new schemas (orchestration, visual analysis, architecture plan,
  visual review) and a workspace-manifest schema, all bound to the
  existing repo-wide validator.
- `tests/routing-fixtures.json` — 16 gestures with the scope each should
  route to, checked for shape; the routing itself is observed in the
  acceptance runs rather than asserted with an LLM in CI.

#### Known gaps

- The Claude Code and Codex **acceptance runs are outstanding** —
  whether a skill fires unprompted in a clean project is not yet
  recorded.
- The five skill fixtures still pin 1.9.0; four fail against 2.2.0
  because `BusinessTheme` left the published library in 2.x. Until they
  are ported, the 2.2 pack's compile-smoke evidence is inherited rather
  than proven and every conceptual skill stays `needs-validation`.

### GraphCompose 1.9.0 — source-generated API allow-list + default retarget
- **New `graphcompose-api-surface` allow-list skill.**
  `skills/versions/graphcompose-1.9/00-api-surface.md` is generated
  straight from the `v1.9.0` GraphCompose source (199 types, 1571
  methods, 197 constants) and is the FIRST skill in the manifest. It is
  the COMPLETE, exact list of every public authoring method/constant for
  1.9.0 — a closed set: a symbol absent from it does not exist for the
  version. This gives the agents a decidable API-existence check instead
  of "skill → Javadoc → guess". `status: active` (verified-by-construction
  against the tag; not a visual render).
- **Vendored generator.** `tools/api-surface/api-index.py` (copied verbatim
  from the GraphCompose repo's `.llm-wiki/tools/api-index/`) regenerates the
  allow-list per release; `tools/api-surface/README.md` documents the
  tag-checkout + generate flow. The generated body is never hand-edited.
- **New `skills/versions/graphcompose-1.9/` pack.** A port of the 1.7 pack
  (1.7.0 → 1.9.0 is additive, zero breaking changes); the frozen
  `graphcompose-1.7/` and `graphcompose-1.6/` snapshots are retained for
  pinned-back projects. All 14 conceptual skills re-stamped
  `verifiedAgainst: 1.9.0` (`status: needs-validation`); version-pinned
  Javadoc lookups now point at 1.9.0 while the historical "New in 1.7.0"
  notes are preserved as accurate version history.
- **New `graphcompose-engine-guides` (how-to-use-the-engine) skill.**
  `tools/api-surface/sync-engine-guides.mjs` vendors the 13 verified,
  render-proven developer guides from the GraphCompose LLM wiki
  (`.llm-wiki/12-docs-extraction/`) into
  `skills/versions/graphcompose-1.9/guides/`, each stamped with a provenance
  header. Where the allow-list says WHAT exists, the guides show HOW to wire
  the primitives. A flow-owned index (`guides/00-index.md`) is the manifest
  entry (`status: needs-validation` until the snippets are re-smoked against
  1.9.0 in this flow). Curated layer, so this is a re-sync, not a `--src`
  regeneration.
- **Lookup priority flipped to skill → allow-list → engine guides → Javadoc.**
  `graphcompose-basics.md` and `skills/README.md` now make the allow-list
  the authoritative existence check ("not listed = does not exist") and the
  engine guides the how-to layer, ahead of the Javadoc.
- **Prompts cite the allow-list as the closed set.**
  `template-coder-agent.md` requires confirming every GraphCompose call
  against the allow-list before writing it; `skill-validator-agent.md`
  gains a pre-compile API-existence gate that diffs generated GraphCompose
  calls against the allow-list BEFORE compile and halts on an invented
  symbol — closing the "compile/render gate but no pre-compile
  API-existence gate" gap.
- **1.9 is the new default target.** `skill-manifest.json` →
  `skillsVersion 0.4.0`, `defaultGraphComposeVersion 1.9.x`,
  `supportedGraphComposeVersions [1.6.x, 1.7.x, 1.9.x]`; the
  `graphcompose-flow init` scaffold default, the five skill-fixture poms,
  the render gate's fallback coordinate (`deriveTargetCoordinate`), the
  CI `skill-fixtures` job, and the `validate-skills` stub all move to
  1.9.0. Existing committed example projects stay pinned at
  `targetGraphComposeVersion: 1.7.0` (their renders carry 1.7.0 parity).
  Verified: `io.github.demchaav:graph-compose:1.9.0` resolves from Maven
  Central and the skill fixtures compile/render against it.

### GraphCompose 1.7.0
- **Dependency bumped 1.6.7 → 1.7.0.** All render-runner, skill-fixture,
  and preview-renderer poms now resolve
  `io.github.demchaav:graph-compose:1.7.0` from Maven Central; every live
  example `template-project.json` (`targetGraphComposeVersion`) and the
  `graphcompose-flow init` scaffold default move with them. 1.7.0 is
  additive over 1.6.x (zero breaking changes), so existing generated
  templates compile and render unchanged.
- **New `skills/versions/graphcompose-1.7/` pack.** A port of the 1.6
  pack (the frozen `graphcompose-1.6/` snapshot is retained for projects
  pinned back) with the v1.7.0 additive primitives folded into the topic
  skills: inline shape runs (rating dots / bullets / arrows / checkboxes
  drawn from geometry, no font glyph), polygon `ShapeOutline` geometry,
  composite inline figures + swappable tick/arrow styles, per-corner
  `roundedRect(...)`, vertical text alignment
  (`verticalAlign(TextVerticalAlign)`), semantic timelines
  (`addTimeline(...)`), dashed/dotted lines (`LineBuilder.dashed(...)`),
  `headingBar(...)`, `softPanel(..., stroke)`, `FontName.JETBRAINS_MONO`,
  `DocumentSession.availableHeight()`, and the nested-stack
  `position(...)` offset fix. The `spacing-and-alignment` "no per-line
  vertical centring" note was corrected for the new `verticalAlign`.
- **Manifest repointed to 1.7.x.** `skill-manifest.json` →
  `skillsVersion 0.3.0`, `defaultGraphComposeVersion 1.7.x`,
  `supportedGraphComposeVersions [1.6.x, 1.7.x]`, all 14 entries
  `verifiedAgainst 1.7.0` (`status: needs-validation` until the render +
  visual-diff loop runs on 1.7.0).
- **Prompts + docs refreshed.** The Architecture Mapper gains mapping
  rows for the 1.7.0 primitives; the Template Coder lists them as Stable,
  surface-agnostic idioms; `AGENTS.md`, the quickstart / overview /
  roadmap / limitations / implementation-status / skill-validation /
  integration docs, README, and CONTRIBUTING move their "current target"
  to 1.7.0 (the pre-1.6.7 JitPack boundary is left intact as history).

### Live preview
- **`live/` mirror.** Every render now also writes a single stable copy of the
  latest output to `live/current.pdf` (plus `current-debug.pdf`, `current.png`,
  `current.txt`) at the repo root, regardless of which project/revision produced
  it. Open `live/current.pdf` once in SumatraPDF (auto-reloads on change, no
  file lock) and watch every render refresh in place — no digging for the latest
  revision folder. Override the location with `GRAPHCOMPOSE_LIVE_DIR`; disable
  with `RENDER_NO_LIVE=1`. The folder is gitignored.
- **`scripts/preview-live.mjs`** (`npm run preview` / `npm run preview:debug`)
  opens the live file in SumatraPDF with `-reuse-instance`, resolving it via
  `SUMATRAPDF_PATH`, `PATH`, or the standard install locations, and falling back
  to the OS default viewer.

### Developer workflow
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents the branch-per-change + release-from-`main`
  workflow that keeps `main` always renderable; `AGENTS.md` carries the
  agent-facing summary ("Working on the flow itself").

## v0.1.0 — 2026-06-03

First tagged release. The kit already turned visual references into
maintainable GraphCompose Java templates; this release makes it easy to pick
up — one-command setup, a dev container, a seedable example, and agent
rule-packs — and refreshes the docs and dependencies.

### Onboarding & tooling
- **One-command setup.** `npm run setup` (or `./setup.ps1` / `./setup.sh`)
  checks the toolchain (Node 20+, npm, Java 21+, Maven), installs and builds
  the local Node tools, and packages the Java preview renderer.
  `npm run setup:check` verifies the toolchain only.
- **Seedable example.** `graphcompose-flow init <name> --template invoice`
  scaffolds a ready-to-render project under `examples/<name>/` (reference,
  render-runner, a DRAFT `revision-001`, and a `render` block); render it
  immediately with `node scripts/render.mjs <name> revision-001`.
- **Dev container.** `.devcontainer/` provisions Java 21 (Temurin) + Maven,
  Node 20, and ImageMagick for GitHub Codespaces / VS Code; `postCreate` runs
  `npm run setup`. Validated with a real container build.
- **Agent rule-packs.** Thin pointers to `AGENTS.md` for Claude Code
  (`CLAUDE.md`), Cursor (`.cursor/rules/`), Windsurf (`.windsurf/rules/`), and
  GitHub Copilot (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`).
- **Pipeline helper.** `scripts/run-pipeline.mjs` prints the ordered agent
  chain for a revision's scope and runs the mechanical render with `--render`.

### Documentation
- README embeds a clickable YouTube walkthrough (plays from GitHub) instead of
  an inline `.mp4`.
- `docs/quickstart.md` leads with the setup script + a Codespaces note; manual
  steps moved into a `<details>` block.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` current-state refreshed: the preview renderer executes
  templates and writes `output.pdf` / `output.png`, and GraphCompose 1.6.7 is
  resolved via Maven Central.

### Dependencies & hygiene
- `vitest` bumped `1.6 → 4.1.8` in `revision-manager` and `visual-diff`,
  clearing all `npm audit` advisories (incl. one critical); tests stay green
  (31 + 39).
- Root-level junk cleanup; `.gitignore` guards for shell-accident filenames and
  the dev-container lockfile; the tooling install path is build-only.

### Skills
- `backgrounds-and-panels` expanded with the real page/section background API
  (`DocumentSession.pageBackground` / `pageBackgrounds`, `section.fillColor`)
  and a "Container fill vs page background" distinction.

### Versioning
- The on-disk artifact contract is now stamped: `template-project.json` and
  `revision.json` carry `schemaVersion: 1` on every write (older files without
  the field are treated as v1, so existing examples stay valid). The CLI tools
  stay repo-internal and versioned lock-step with the repo — not published to
  npm yet.

### Deferred (intentionally not in this release)
- `init --template cv` — a data-driven, multi-page CV seed; the invoice
  template ships now and cv follows in a later release.
- Publishing the CLI tools to npm — they stay repo-internal until there is a
  reason to publish.
